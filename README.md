**makespec** simplifies creation and management of specifications and
documentations. The program consists of a set of makefiles and templates to
generate human-readable documents (HTML, PDF...) and formal schema files (OWL,
Turtle, Relax-NG, BNF...) from a common source document written in [Pandoc
Markdown](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html).
Makespec also supports generating and updating [GitHub
pages](http://pages.github.com/) to publish the specification at GitHub. Feel
free to reuse, [comment](https://github.com/jakobib/makespec/issues), fork, and
modify makespec! The current version can be found at
<https://github.com/jakobib/makespec>.
